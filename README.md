# RL-Bender
## Explanation of some symbols:
* γ ("gamma") - this is the discount rate. The more steps into a board bender 
* Ɛ ("episolon") - this is the likelihood of selecting a non-optimal action. This is the tendency to explore represented, versus the tendency to exploit any previous training.
* η ("eta") - The learning rate; this slows the impact of data as the agent learns.
